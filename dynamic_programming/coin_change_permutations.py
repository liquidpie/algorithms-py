"""
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, 
and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

For example, 
For N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. 
So output should be 4. 
For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. 
So output should be 5.

To count the total number of solutions, we can divide all set solutions into two sets.
1) Solutions that do not contain mth coin (or Sm).
2) Solutions that contain at least one Sm.

Let count(S[], m, n) be the function to count the number of solutions, 
then it can be written as sum of count(S[], m-1, n) and count(S[], m, n-Sm).

where m is the size of coin set.
