    Given an array arr[0 â€¦ n-1] containing n positive integers, a subsequence of arr[] is called Bitonic
    if it is first increasing, then decreasing. Write a function that takes an array as argument and returns the length
    of the longest bitonic subsequence.
    A sequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic with the decreasing part as empty.
    Similarly, decreasing order sequence is considered Bitonic with the increasing part as empty.
    Examples:

    Input arr[] = {1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1};
    Output: 6 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 6 is 1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1)

    Input arr[] = {12, 11, 40, 5, 3, 1}
    Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 12, 11, 5, 3, 1)

    Input arr[] = {80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10}
    Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 80, 60, 30, 20, 10)


    Approach:
    This problem is a variation of standard Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem.
    Let the input array be arr[] of length n. We need to construct two arrays lis[] and lds[]
    using Dynamic Programming solution of LIS problem.
    lis[i] stores the length of the Longest Increasing subsequence ending with arr[i].
    lds[i] stores the length of the longest Decreasing subsequence starting from arr[i].
    Finally, we need to return the max value of lis[i] + lds[i] â€“ 1 where i is from 0 to n-1.

            if arr[i] > arr[j] and lds[i] < lds[j] + 1:
                lds[i] = lds[j] + 1

    maximum = lis[0] + lds[0] - 1

        maximum = max(maximum, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1)
