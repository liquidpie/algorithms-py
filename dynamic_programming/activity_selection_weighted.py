def max_profit_activity_selection(activity, n):
    """
    Also known as Weighted Job Scheduling

    Given N jobs where every job is represented by following three elements of it.

    Start Time
    Finish Time
    Profit or Value Associated (>= 0)

    Find the maximum profit subset of jobs such that no two jobs in the subset overlap.

    Example:

        Input: Number of Jobs n = 4
               Job Details [Start Time, Finish Time, Profit]
               Job 1:  [1, 2, 50]
               Job 2:  [3, 5, 20]
               Job 3:  [6, 19, 100]
               Job 4:  [2, 100, 200]
        Output: The maximum profit is 250.
        We can get the maximum profit by scheduling jobs 1 and 4.
        Note that there is longer schedules possible Jobs 1, 2 and 3
        but the profit with this schedule is 20+50+100 which is less than 250.

    The Greedy Strategy for activity selection doesnâ€™t work here as a schedule with more jobs may have smaller profit or value.

    Approach:

        1) First sort jobs according to finish time.
        2) Now apply following recursive process.
           // Here arr[] is array of n jobs
           findMaximumProfit(arr[], n)
           {
             a) if (n == 1) return arr[0];
             b) Return the maximum of following two profits.
                 (i) Maximum profit by excluding current job, i.e.,
                     findMaximumProfit(arr, n-1)
                 (ii) Maximum profit by including the current job
           }

        How to find the profit including current job?
        The idea is to find the latest job before the current job (in
        sorted array) that doesn't conflict with current job 'arr[n-1]'.
        Once we find such a job, we recur for all jobs till that job and
        add profit of current job to result.
        In the above example, "job 1" is the latest non-conflicting
        for "job 4" and "job 2" is the latest non-conflicting for "job 3".

    Time Complexity of the above Dynamic Programming Solution is O(n2).
    Note that the this solution can be optimized to O(nLogn) using Binary Search in _get_previous_non_conflicting() instead of linear search.
